# CommandHandler-Public
This is the public repo CH2(?) [which is private] for the general public to make suggestions for features, commands, and more.

What is CH2?
CH2 is the 2nd version of the CommandHandler [@Bowu20](https://github.com/Bowu20) created to making bots in Go Lang as easy as it was in [Discord.js-Commando](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-commando).
